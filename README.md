Academic homepage example
=========================

This is source code for my academic [homepage](http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~sangjin/).

Things we all know:

* All researchers (not to mention graduate students) should have their own homepage.
* 90's-looking academic homepage is not cool.
* You should not spend too much time for non-research stuff.

Feel free to copy this webpage and customize it for your own:

1. Install Jekyll.
1. Modify the contents.
1. Run Jekyll.
1. Copy the result in \_site/ to your web server
